Some college students are enlightened enough to figure out their career path while in school. In my case, it took me a few years after graduating with a Masterâ€™s degree that I realized a career in Accounts wasnâ€™t for me.

Former Accountant turned Digital Marketer, driven by a goal to learn every day. Iâ€™m highly passionate about utilizing my detail-oriented mindset in the ever-expanding world of marketing (& operations).

At Kretaro I focus mainly on internal processes but I also have the opportunity to collaborate cross-departmentally to handle the customer support and weigh-in on our go-to digital marketing strategy.

I am proud to work at a People tech company that strives to be the worldâ€™s first & only credibility platform that enables individuals to show and check anyoneâ€™s credibility at any time. No matter how you look at it, Kretaro is the future, a world where rejection is a myth and your credibility wins.

**These days I am working on:**
